PCBs are labelled with revision number in the lower right corner.

Rev0 uses ProMicro with micro-usb as designed by [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12640).

Rev0.1 uses ProMicro wiith mini-usb as can be found by various retailers elsewhere on the internet. 
Dimensions for the ProMicro mini-usb are 39.5mm x 23mm. I do not garantee that your ProMicro will fit the board.
