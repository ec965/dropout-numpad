## Firmware
Uses [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware).
Work in progress.

## Sandwhich Case
Amount | Part | Dimensions
--- | --- | ---
5 | M2 F-F standoffs | 13mm (5mm from plate to pcb, 1.6mm thick pcb, 6.2mm thick pro-micro)
10 | M2 screws | 4mm
4 | rubber bumpon feet

Sandwhich! (parts in this order from top down)
*  Plate
*  PCB
*  Extra PCB or Bottom Plate

## Updates
PCBs are labelled with revision number in the lower right corner.

12/6 - 
Rev0.3 PCB Panelization

12/? - Rev0.2 uses ProMicro (mini-usb). Mounting holes have been moved to prevent interference with stablizier wire. Board outline was also slightly adjusted. I also created a plate pcb. Because some dimensions changed between rev0.1 and rev0.2, the plate will not fit on older revisions.

12/? - Rev0.1 uses ProMicro wiith mini-usb as can be found by various retailers elsewhere on the internet. 
Dimensions for the ProMicro mini-usb are 39.5mm x 23mm. I do not garantee that your ProMicro will fit the board.

12/? - Rev0 uses ProMicro with micro-usb as designed by [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12640).


## To Do

It's called dropout, cuz I just dropped out.
