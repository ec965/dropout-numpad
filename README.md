# Dropout 
## PCB
### (mechanical numpad w/ roatry encoder)

## PCB Revisions
PCBs are labelled with revision number in the lower right corner.

Rev0.2 uses ProMicro (mini-usb). Mounting holes have been moved to prevent interference with stablizier wire. Board outline was also slightly adjusted. I also created a plate pcb. Because some dimensions changed between rev0.1 and rev0.2, the plate will not fit on older revisions.

Rev0.1 uses ProMicro wiith mini-usb as can be found by various retailers elsewhere on the internet. 
Dimensions for the ProMicro mini-usb are 39.5mm x 23mm. I do not garantee that your ProMicro will fit the board.

Rev0 uses ProMicro with micro-usb as designed by [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12640).

## Firmware
Uses [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware).


## Sandwhich Case
M2 standoffs
M2 screws


## To Do
Have mounting point in the FR4 plate.
Have larger holes in pcb to accomodate the M2 standoffs


It's called dropout, cuz I just dropped out.
